# **Machine Learning Projects**

This repository contains a collection of beginner–intermediate Machine Learning projects built using Python, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Scikit-Learn.  
Each notebook focuses on a core ML concept including regression, classification, data preprocessing, EDA, and model evaluation.
